         <li>One click to perform a backup</li>
         <li>Configurable settings</li>

         The first time you run Snap Backup, you configure where
         your data files reside and where to create backup files.&nbsp; Snap Backup
         will also copy your backup to an archive location, such as a USB flash drive
         (memory stick), external hard drive, or
         <a href=http://blog.centerkey.com/2012/03/snap-backup-dropbox-free-cloud-backup.html
         class=external-site>cloud backup</a>.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup automatically puts the current date in the backup file name,
         alleviating you from the tedious task of renaming your backup
         file every time you backup.&nbsp; The backup file is a single compressed
         file that can be read by zip programs such as gzip, 7-Zip, The Unarchiver,
         and Mac's built-in Archive Utility.
