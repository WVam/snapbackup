      <ul>
         <li>A single click to perform a backup</li>
         <li>Configurable settings</li>

         The first time you run Snap Backup, you configure where your data files reside and where
         to create backup files.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup will also copy your backup to an archive location, such as a USB flash drive
         (memory stick), external hard drive, or
         <a href=https://blog.centerkey.com/2012/03/snap-backup-dropbox-free-cloud-backup.html
         class=external-site>cloud backup</a>.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup automatically puts the current date in the backup file name, alleviating you
         from the tedious task of renaming your backup file every time you backup.&nbsp;
         The backup file is a single compressed zip file that can be read by standard zip programs
         such as gzip, 7-Zip, The Unarchiver, and Mac's built-in Archive Utility.

      <h2>Take control</h2>
      <p>
         System administrators have backup procedures for their company servers, databases, and
         network files.&nbsp;
         Individual computer users, on the other hand, are usually left to fend for
         themselves.&nbsp;
         Snap Backup is the simple answer for individual users, in the corporation or at home, who
         want to protect their valuable data.
